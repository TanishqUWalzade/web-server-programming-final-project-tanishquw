                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>
                    Founded in 2026 by fitness enthusiast and certified trainer Tanishq Umesh Walzade, FitLife began as a small personal training studio 
                    with a mission to make fitness accessible to everyone. What started with just 50 members has grown into a thriving community 
                    of over 2,000 fitness enthusiasts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our journey has been driven by a simple belief: that fitness is not just about physical transformation, but about building 
                    confidence, community, and a healthier lifestyle. Today, FitLife stands as the region's premier fitness destination.
