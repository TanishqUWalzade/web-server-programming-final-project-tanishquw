# Assignment-3 (Bulma)

**Reference:** https://newpaltz-examples.onrender.com/static/bulma/todo.html?#

## Objective

Recreate the layout and components from the reference Bulma Todo page using Bulma CSS and HTML. The goal was to match the look and structure of the example, including the navbar dropdown, cards, tabs, table-based todo list, message panel, and form section.

## What I implemented

- Navbar with a hoverable dropdown menu (Docs to links).
- Left card part with header/content/footer.
- Todo section with tabs + new task input + task list table.
- Message component with progress bar.
- Form with Bulma field/control layout and browser validation for email.
- Right side part using Bulma’s menu component.
